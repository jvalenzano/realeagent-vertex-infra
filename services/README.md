## Example Query
```bash
"Create purchase agreement for 789 Ocean View Drive, $1.2M, built 1975, 30-day escrow"
```

**Expected Result:**
- Extracts: address, price ($1.2M), year (1975), escrow period (30 days)
- Identifies: CA_RPA form needed
- Triggers: Lead Paint Disclosure (pre-1978 property)
- Returns: Complete form package with compliance

## Quick Test
```bash
# Test the complete pipeline (once orchestrator is deployed)
curl -X POST https://orchestrator-209579160014.us-central1.run.app/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Create purchase agreement for 789 Ocean View Drive, $1.2M, built 1975, 30-day escrow"}'
```
